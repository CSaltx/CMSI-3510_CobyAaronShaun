====================================
Project: change multiple file names using a single command
Type:    likely a core utility; possibly a kernel command

Evaluation
----------

Good work on this submission

Pretty good explanation in section 1.1 ~ you could say a bit more or give
   an example of what you mean, like providing an example of the syntax of
   the command to change the files, something like:

   command syntax:  rengrp old_name_pattern new_name_pattern
      this command would change all files matching the old name pattern
      to have the new name pattern.  Files not matching the old names
      would not be affected.

Good rationale in section 1.2 as well ~ this is a good idea!  I have a file
   utility for windows called "rename" that does this in a GUI, letting you
   change the file names in a directory to match a new pattern.  For example
   if I have a list of files that are 'example1.txt', 'example2.txt', etc,
   I can change them easily to be 'example01.txt', 'example02.txt' and so on,
   which I have had to do frequently

In Section 1.3 ~ Good start here, although I don't know if you'll actually
   need to modify the file system code.  You may just need to call functions
   from it to accomplish the task with your new module.

Section 1.4 ~ if you are writing an entirely new module for this, you should
   name it according to what your command would be.  For example, you could
   call it "rnall" for "rename all" or "mvm" for "move 'em" or something like
   that, just as suggestions, but you would want to name the new module to a
   name that is the same as the command.

Decent job overall!

An "A-minus" job on this first project deliverable ~ professional-quality
   work!
