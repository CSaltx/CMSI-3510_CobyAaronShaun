Another good job on this submission

Good for section 2.1

I like the name of the command as you present it in section 2.2, it's
   descriptive but uses the UNIX naming convention of "rn" for "rename" and
   tacks on the "all" to that.

   The phrase is actually "...base our command ON the regular..." not OFF ~
   the use of 'base' means that is something you are building onto, hence
   not "off"  You actually use "on" correctly in the previous paragraph in
   this section!  :D

In Section 2.3 ~ good enough; since you're only making a new module, you
   only need to show that module in this section.  You could make things a
   bit more specific [detailed?] by describing in text what each of the two
   fields is for, and how your four functions will each do its job.

   Will you be parsing the regex yourselves, or will you use a library call
   to parse that to match the file names for input and output?

In Section 2.4 ~ excellent description of how it will work, with good sample
   commands.  Since there are no command line 'switches', this is all you'll
   need for this section.

very nice work overall!

An "A" job on this second project deliverable ~ professional-quality
   work!
